# Automatic-Attendance-Recording-system-using-Realtime-face-recognition

The system uses cloud-based face identification to accurately record and monitor the attendance of University students in lectures via a video live stream. Accessed over an easy-to-use web interface, our software uses a standard webcam and Microsoft Azure web services to determine people coming into a lecture theatre. Trained using machine-learning algorithms on only a small sample of images, it uses Microsoft Azure's Face API - a REST API with a high level of accuracy - to quickly and efficiently inform a lecturer as to whether a student is present in the class. In the background, an SQL Azure database stores a catalog of students, their course information and timetables, amongst other information. The front end consists of a START and STOP button which makes the system easy to use and it also has a Generate Pdf button to download the pdf report of the present student.
